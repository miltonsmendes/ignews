App resulted from a study on Rocketseat's ReactJS bootcamp. A JAMSTACK application.

These following technologies were used:
  * ReactJS
  * Typescript
  * SASS
  * CSS Modules
  * NextJS
  * NextAuth (Autentication) 
  * Stripe API (Payment API)
  * FaunaDB (DataBase)
  * Prismic ( CMS )

In this App I could pratice these features:
  * Build an autentication system using third social apps (Github account)
  * API Routes
  * Static Pages ( SPA )
  * Server Side Redering ( SSR )
  * Webhooks ( Integration between API's )
  * ContextAPI
  * Organization with Typescript
  * Introduction about DataBase integration with FrontEnd
  * Dynamic pages
